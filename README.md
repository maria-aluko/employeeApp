# HR application for practicing React

This is my school project to practice React while building an employee HR app. I will be working on the following React concepts:

- **Employee Directory:** View and manage employees dynamically - builing reusable and well-structured Components.
- **Role Management:** Promote or demote employees with visual feedback - conditional rendering.
- **Form Handling:** Add and edit employee details dynamically - POST requests with axios.
- **Routing:** Seamlessly navigate between application pages - React-router-dom and Navigation.
- **API Integration:** Fetch, update, and manage employee data using a mock backend - GET and PATCH requests with axios.
- **Optimization:** Modular styling, reusable hooks, and clean architecture.
